            Voice is natural, voice is human. That’s why we’re fascinated with
            creating usable voice technology for our machines. But to create
            voice systems, an extremely large amount of voice data is required.
            Most of the data used by large companies isn’t available to the
            majority of people. We think that stifles innovation. So we’ve
            launched Project Common Voice, a project to help make voice
            recognition open to everyone.{' '}
